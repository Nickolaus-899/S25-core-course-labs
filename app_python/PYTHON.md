# Python application for showing time at Moscow

### Run application with the command
```python
python3 app.py
```

### Framework: `Flask`
I have chosen this lightweight web framework due to its simplicity
in usage. It is easy to create a toy web application with Flask.
Moreover, it is flexible and easy to extend in the future if needed.

### Best practices
* **Modularity**: methods are splitted to separate functions
